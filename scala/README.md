# Scala

In the file **main.scala**, you will find 4 tasks. Each task consists of a task description, a declared function body, and a description of the returned values.
The tasks are expected to be written according Scala 3.3.1 syntax. 

## Preconditions

To work on the tasks in Scala, you need to install [Scala CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install/) tool.

**Scala CLI** combines all the features you need to compile the tasks and run tests.

While you are free to use other tools, itâ€™s recommended to preserve the files structure and Scala CLI directives (lines starting with //> at the beginning of a file).

Here are some useful links for setting up your preferred IDE:

## Compile

To compile run `scala-cli compile .` 


## Tests 

There is also a file called **tests.scala**, which contains tests for your assignments. These tests are for self-testing purposes, and passing them does not necessarily mean that the task was completed correctly.

To execute tests run `scala-cli tests .`

You are free to add additional test cases to **tests.scala**

Example of passed tests:
```shell
Task1FastSearch:
  + none for empty sequence 0.001s
  + int 0.003s
  + page 0.206s
  + card 0.002s
Task2FinobacciIterator:
  + first fibonacci number 0.001s
  + 6th  fibonacci number 0.0s
  + 10000th fibonacci number 0.011s
Task3PowFunc:
  + powFunc(3)(3) = 27 0.001s
  + powFunc(3)(2) = 8 0.0s
  + powFunc(2)(3) = 9 0.0s
Task4FileList:
  + There are no tests for this task(( 0.02s
```

Example of failed tests:

```shell
Task1FastSearch:
==> X Task1FastSearch.int  0.016s munit.ComparisonFailException: scala/tests.scala:37
36:        val seq = (10 to 1000).toIndexedSeq
37:        assertEquals(fastSearch(seq, 10), Some(1))
38:        assertEquals(fastSearch(seq, 9), None)
values are not the same
=> Obtained
Some(
  value = 0
)
=> Diff (- obtained, + expected)
 Some(
-  value = 0
+  value = 1
 )
    at munit.FunSuite.assertEquals(FunSuite.scala:11)
    at Task1FastSearch.$init$$$anonfun$2(tests.scala:37)
```
