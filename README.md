The project is organized into directories corresponding to each task, which are further categorized based on programming languages or topics. To submit your solutions:

1. Create a public repository.
2. Commit your code to this repository.
3. Send us the repository link via email.

It's essential to prioritize the readability and cleanliness of your code, rather than solely focusing on solving the tasks.

### Notes:
Completion of all tasks is not mandatory. Please focus on tasks that align with your skills and time availability. 
Successfully completing tasks in SQL, BASH, and at least one programming language is good. 
Additionally, if you can tackle CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges, it will be an advantage.
