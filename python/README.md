# Python
To do tasks in Python you first need to install the correct
version of Python (3.9+) for your operating system.
Once you have Python installed, you can start writing code to execute your Python programs in an 
editor such as IDLE, or in the command line.

In file **main.py** you'll find 4 tasks, each task consists of a description of the task,
a declared function body and a description of the returned values.

When writing Python code, you need to remember to use proper indentation and follow
the correct syntax. This ensures that your code is easy to read and understand.

There is also a file **tests.py** , which has a test for your assignments. 
They're for self-testing, your implementations must pass all of them (but it does not necessarily mean that the task was completed correctly).

To execute tests run test.py file.

* Example of a passed test:
```shell
------------------------------
Start test test_first_task
Testing test_first_task passed successfully
------------------------------
```

* Example of a failed test:
```shell
------------------------------
Start test test_first_task
Testing test_first_task fails test case not passed throw assertion. 
Card index must be 35, but found 0, Test case â„–1 failed
------------------------------
```
### You are not allowed to change the code in the file test.py
