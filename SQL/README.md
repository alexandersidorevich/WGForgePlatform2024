# SQL

To do tasks in SQL, you need to install a database management system, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, and create a
database.
You should then use the SQL language to do tasks, such as creating tables and querying the database.

When writing SQL queries, you need to remember to use the correct syntax and follow the proper conventions.

In the **example.sql** file you will find two tasks which must be done using SQL: one for database design and one
for query construction.
