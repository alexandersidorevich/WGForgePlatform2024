# CTF
CTF ([Capture the Flag](https://ctf101.org/)) is a hacking competition where contestants need to exploit vulnerabilities in various tasks to get a flag. A flag is a string which starts with CTF (e.g. CTF{th1s_ls_n0t_a_f1ag}). Try your hacking skills in a task from a CTF.

###### Note: The task requires you to perform an sql injection attack, no brute forcing needed.
